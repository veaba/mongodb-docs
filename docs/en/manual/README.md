Welcome to the MongoDB 4.0 Manual! MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of development and scaling. The Manual introduces key concepts in MongoDB, presents the query language, and provides operational and administrative considerations and procedures as well as a comprehensive reference section. The manual is also available as [HTML tar.gz](http://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/manual.tar.gz) and [EPUB](http://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/MongoDB-manual.epub).


MongoDB offers both a *Community* and an *Enterprise* version of the database:


- MongoDB Community is the [source available and free to use](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/) edition of MongoDB.
- MongoDB Enterprise is available as part of the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced subscription and includes comprehensive support for your MongoDB deployment. MongoDB Enterprise also adds enterprise-focused features such as LDAP and Kerberos support, on-disk encryption, and auditing.


The Manual documents both MongoDB Community and Enterprise features and functionality.
